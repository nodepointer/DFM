              After several years of living in Castle Rock and trying to find a
              doctor I felt comfortable with, I met Dr Dalton Mackay. Above all
              she listens to you and has a wealth of knowledge that made me feel
              very comfortable and that my overall health was her priority and I
              have always trusted her advice. She is very accessible and
              responds quickly to my questions, which is rare in the medical
              world. Dr Mackay also has a network of doctors (specialists/surgeons)
              and health providers that she has referred me to and I have been
              pleased with each referral. I have referred several of my friends
              and clients to her practice and emphatically recommend her as your
              primary doctor!

              I have been a patient of Dr. Mackay for over ten years. Dr. Mackay
              is a God send to me. She has been there for me through all of the
              health issues that have occurred since I started seeing her. From
              serious female issues, to psoriasis that became three different
              forms of arthritis and fibromyalgia. With out a second thought,
              Dr. Mackay understood the pain I was suffering and she found the
              best solution to make life more manageable. She has been an
              emotional support to me as my marriage broke down and a shoulder
              to lean on when life became unbearable. Dr. Mackay is more than my
              primary care doctor, she has become a very dear friend to me. I
              thank God everyday for sending me to her office years back. Dr.
              Mackay is a rare doctor, always available, caring, and she takes
              the time to listen to you. I never feel rushed, or put off. God
              bless this wonderful person and caring doctor. You have my heart
              Dr. Mackay!!!!

              Dr. Dalton Mackay is the perfect blend of knowledge and
              compassion. She takes her time with each patient and is not only
              personable, but she also includes you in your own treatment
              planning. She makes you feel like a person and not just a patient.
              I can say with 100% certainty that she is the best doctor I have
              ever had.

            <p>
              I have had the honor of having Dr Mackay as my primary care Dr for
              about 17 years. When I first met her I couldn't believe that I had
              found a wonderful female Dr that was so kind and professional and
              worked with me as a unique individual patient and not just another
              patient. She listens, she hears what you tell her and she advises
              in accordance with what the health concern I would be having . Not
              only is she professional but I would say she is a Healer. She
              helps you understand what she believes needs to be done. She takes
              everything about your needs into consideration. She's direct but
              she listens and doesn't just give you solutions that you just told
              her you didn't care for. She guides you through everything and
              always follows through to make sure you're ok. Dr Mackay has taken
              care of my three girls with all their various health challenges
              and my husband as well. Having Dr. Mackay as my health advisor has
              given me peace all these years. I really believe she's not only an
              MD but truly a healer!!!!

            <p>So glad we found Dr. Mackay! She has been servicing our entire family for 
              years now and we wouldn't go anywhere else! She's extremely personable 
              and truly cares about her patients' health and helping them be 
              their best selves.</p>
